##### Predictive Model for Coronary Heart Disease

My name is Arend Petzold, I have made a Predictive Model for Coronary Heart Disease that predicts the Coronary Heart Disease with relatively high performance.

##### Data Source

All the data was downloaded direct from https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html

##### End Note

I hope my code can provide good insights in the the predictability of Coronary Heart Disease with AI-Models. Happy for any feedback on the Processing, Methods, Validation and Visualisation of the data. Cheers!
